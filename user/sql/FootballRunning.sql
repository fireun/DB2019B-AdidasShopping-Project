'When it comes to the construction of the Adidas Samba Classic boot, it has been built to last. Starting with the upper, Adidas made use of a full grain synthetic material. This material can feel quite stiff from out of the box but becomes very soft once broken in. 
Additionally, the forefoot and the toe box are covered with a thick suede material. This is to avoid abrasion as well as to provide protection for the foot. 
The football boot also features a tongue and a central lacing system for adjustability and to create the best fit possible. An additional lace hole is present to provide a more secure fit. 
The insoles are non-removable and are made from die-cut Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) to ensure comfort. An arch support foam has been integrated into the insole, as well. 
To provide a good grip on indoor surfaces, the outsole is made from gum rubber. It has a non-marking feature which is ideal for indoor courts'),

For women, the Adidas Ace 17.1 features a Kangaroo leather forefoot with a PrimeMesh on the quarter. 

Being the only model featuring a lacing system in the Adidas Ace 17 silo, the Adidas Ace 17.1 men’s model features three lace holes above the toe box to create more stability to the boot. The women’s version features a traditional lacing system.
